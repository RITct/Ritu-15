						<h2>The Wire Words</h2>
						<p>The wire words is an electrical wiring competition which tests 

the understanding and wiring capabilities of the participants. The 

competition is designed in three levels to meet the event objectives.</p>
					<h2>Objectives :</h2>
					<p>To test the basic knowledge about electrical wiring.</p>
					<p>To test the hands on performance.</p>
					<p>To test the practical knowledge.</p>
				    </div>
					<div class="content-2"><br/>
					<h2>Level 1 - 1 Hr</h2>
						<p>The participants will be given a set of questions which they will

have to answer in the given time. Based on the result the initial 

screening will be done. The question pattern can be multiple choice or 

numerical, but mainly based on electrical wiring.</p>
					<p>Also the participants will be given a set of conditions and layout and 

they will have to develop the circuit that satisfies it.</p>
					<h2>Level 2 - 1 Hr</h2>
						<p>The participants will have to wire up the circuit they have

developed in the previous level within the specified time. The circuits 

which are completed within the time limit will be considered for 

evaluation and based on the result the participants will qualify to the 

next level.</p>
					<h2>Level 3 -  2 Hr</h2>
						<p>The participants will be given a civil plan. They will have to

draw the wiring diagram for it and do the estimation within the time 

limit. On completion of the time limit their performance will be 

evaluated and the winners will be decided.</p>
				    </div>
			        <div class="content-3"><br/>
                        <p>A team of 2 members can participate in this event.</p>
					<h2>First Level : Questionnaire</h2>
						<p>It consists of minimum 20 questions. 15 questions based on

wiring and components. 5 questions general. Scores are to be the 

criteria for selection to the next level. In case a tie occurs the team 

with highest score in 'wiring and component' specific question section 

should be given priority. The circuit diagram for the provided layout 

should be accurate.</p>
					<h2>Second level : Hands on</h2>
						<p>Only the final circuit will be evaluated. The accuracy of the 

output will be the first criteria. In case of a tie the time taken for 

implementation along with neatness of the circuit will be 

considered.</p>
					<h2>Third level : Being pratical</h2>
						<p>Hand drawing of the wiring diagram is needed. The component 

specifications with quantity are also necessary. Evaluation will be 

based on the practicality, neatness, closeness to standards, knowledge 

of component ratings etc.</p>
