							<h2>About Us</h2>
							
							<p>Acclaimed as one of the best engineering college in the state of Kerala, Govt. Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, has been imparting top-notch technological excellence to students from all over the country for the past 23 years. Spread over a sprawling 90 acres of luscious and picturesque greenery, we have stood by our Vision and crafted an outstanding center for technical excellence on account of the pedagogical superiority of the faculty, the academic excellence of the students, state-of-the-art lab facilities and the distinctive co-curricular subtlety. 
								<br /><br />
							The institute is poised to be a temple of science and technology with many of the recent inceptions such as the proposed Ramanujan Institute of Basic Sciences, the fully functional Rapid prototyping facility, Circuit Incubation center and the Soil testing facility are exceptional to this engineering institute. RITU has been conceived to unveil the true grit and shine of our institute, a platform to test and enhance the student community’s fineness. The tech-fest will amalgamate the five B.Tech Departments, the B.Arch. Department and the PG Departments for a fine exertion towards RITU’s triumph.</p>

							<h2>Chapter I.</h2>
							<h3>What makes RITU so special?</h3>
							<h4>rang - illumination - treasures - unity</h4>
							
							<p>Our institute hosted numerous department-wise tech-fests of national standards that doubled up as the proving grounds of the students’ intellectual and management requisites for hosting events of such splendid scales.</p>
							
							<ul style="font-size:17px;">
							<li>When all those technical and management expertise are put into action for a single grand event, RITU will be a techno cultural-fest sustained by the perfect blend of talent and workforce.</li>
							<br/>
							<li>All the professional acquaintances and alliances from the former tech-fests will be utilized to the high point, ensuring a top-level industrial affiliation. </li>
							<br/>
							<li>An average public turnout of 500 people per day for the former tech-fests is much more than an assurance to the reach RITU will possess.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The citations clearly imply the extent to which RITU will be an out-of-the-ordinary feat and an event of such unprecedented success and scope that it’ll exclaim the dawn of the golden epoch of our institute.</p>

							<h3>Why sponsor RITU?</h3>

							</ul>
							<p>We are confident that by now you are well-acquainted with the features of RITU and we are profoundly optimistic that you would render us the essentials for accomplishing RITU as a feat of excellence, as a feat that would benchmark the quality of a techno-cultural fest, as a feat with a null possibility for  supersedence.</p>
