## About Govt. Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology

Acclaimed as one of the best engineering college in the state of Kerala, Govt. Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, has been imparting top-notch technological excellence to students from all over the country for the past 22 years, and perpetually offering a meritorious stratum of proficient technocrats. Over the two decades of vivacious presence, we had stood by our Vision and crafted an outstanding center for technical excellence on account of the pedagogical superiority of the faculty, the academic excellence of the students, state-of-the-art lab facilities and the distinctive co-curricular subtlety.
The institute is poised to be a temple of science and technology with many of the recent inceptions and enlargements, some of which like the recently inducted School of Architecture, the proposed Ramanujan Institute of Basic Sciences, the fully functional Rapid prototyping facility, Circuit Incubation center and the Soil testing facility are exceptional to this engineering institute.
RITU has been conceived to unveil the true grit and shine of our institute, a platform to test and enhance the student community’s fineness. With an estimated budget of over 25 lakhs, it’ll be nothing short of grandeur with the pinnacle of technical stateliness and a robust exemplar of top-class management. The tech-fest will amalgamate the five B.Tech Departments, the B.Arch. Department and the PG Departments for a fine exertion towards RITU’s triumph. With the expertise and dexterity gained from the numerous National-level tech-fests hosted and competed by the students of the institute, it’s unreasonable to doubt their resolve in hosting RITU.
